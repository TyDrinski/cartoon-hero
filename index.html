		<h2>About Darth Vader</h2>
		<p>Originally known as Anakin Skywalker, he was turned to the dark side of the force by his master Darth Sidious. Upon his turn to the dark side, Darth Vader led the 501st clone troopers to the Jedi Temple where they slaughtered everyone. After the massacre of the Jedi Temple he went to Mustafar, where the leaders for the Seperatist Army awaited what their "reward" promised to them by Darth Sidious. Their reward was death, given to them by the dark lord. <br><br> Obi-wan Kenobi eventually made his way to the planet of Mustafar to confront Lord Vader. There, on the shores of Mustafar's lava river, Jedi Master Kenobi defeated Darth Vader by severing his right arm and both legs with his lightsaber. At that point Darth Vader caught fire and began to burn alive which also damaged his lungs. The only thing that kept him alive was the dark side of the force fueled by his hatred and pain. <br><br> After being rescued by his new master Darth Sidious, Vader was given new cybernetic limbs and a mechanical suit that was able to keep him alive. This suit was designed to keep Darth Vader in continuous pain which gave him great power while using the dark side. Not only was Darth Vader a Sith Apprentice, but he was also a shadowy enforcer for the new Galactic Empire.</p>
